# The-Adventurist
A Java based RPG game designed in grade 10.

#### Details:
- 2 folders:
    - RPG M. VX: original version of the game created in grade 8
        - My first ever designed game.
        - Sparked my interest in the Software Engieering field of study
        - Developed a strong passion for coding and game development:
            - Designed my own custom DVD cover as if the game was in actual production
            - NOTE: I CLAIM NO COPYRIGHT ON THE TRADEMARKS, BRANDS, OR COMPANIES THAT WERE DISPLAYED IN THE DVD COVER. THEY WERE PLACED TO MOCK MY GAME AS AN OFFICIAL PRODUCT. THE DVD COVER WAS DESIGNED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

    - Java: redesigned version of the RPG M. VX game with my own Java implementation and custom graphs 
        - First ever fully coded game.
        - Turned my vision of game development into a reality after learning core Java

#### Technical design:
- Designed with Java paint canvas
- Custom designed maps, sprites, and UI
- Event based game design: story adapts based on how user plays
- Designed and implemented a custom battle engine for enemy battle sequences
- Keyboard and Mouse listeners
- Modular design with function calls for each component of the game
- Helped introduce OOP principles.
